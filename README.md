# UCF-Crimes
Open-Source Code for official UCF Crimes Discord Server. Collaboration Project by Ethan Frakes, Jack Sweeney, and Maverick Reynolds.

~~~

UCF Crimes gathers data from the UCFPD crime log and posts information to Instagram and Discord. Incidents are made public according to the Clery Act, a federal law that requires all U.S. colleges and universities (including foreign campuses of U.S. institutions), both public and private, participating in federal student aid programs to maintain and disclose certain crime statistics and campus security/fire information. All information republished by UCF Crimes is gathered directly from the UCFPD Daily Crime log, and no erronous is false information is injected into the posts.

The UCF Crimes Discord has ability to query over dates and locations. More options will be available in the future.
