The UCF Crimes Discord has ability to query over dates, locations, report titles or status. Incidents are made public according to the Clery Act, a federal law that requires all U.S. colleges and universities (including foreign campuses of U.S. institutions), both public and private, participating in federal student aid programs to maintain and disclose certain crime statistics and campus security/fire information. All information republished by UCF Crimes is gathered directly from the UCFPD daily crime log, and no erronous or false information is injected into the posts.
